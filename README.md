# C++ Programming

Welcome to my C++ Programming repository! This collection showcases various C++ programs designed to help learners understand and practice fundamental and advanced concepts in C++ programming.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on topics:

- **Basics**: Fundamental C++ concepts like variables, data types, and operators.
- **Functions**: Demonstrates the use of functions in C++.
- **Loops**: Examples of different looping mechanisms.
- **Arrays**: Working with arrays in C++.
- **Pointers**: Introduction to pointers and their usage.
- **Recursion**: Understanding recursion through examples.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of basic data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Examples of various sorting techniques.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the programs locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sahil-Shrivas/Cpp-Programming.git

## ðŸ§­ What Youâ€™ll Find Here

Inside this repository, youâ€™ll see folders and files covering:

- **Arrays & Strings**: basic operations, two-pointer techniques, sliding window  
- **Linked Lists**: singly, doubly, circular, insertion/deletion operations  
- **Stacks & Queues**: implementation using arrays or linked lists, and common problems  
- **Trees & Binary Search Trees**: traversal, insertion, deletion, balancing  
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s, Bellman-Ford)  
- **Heaps & Priority Queues**: max-heap, min-heap, heap sort  
- **Dynamic Programming**: knapsack, LIS, subset sum, etc.  
- **Greedy Algorithms**: interval scheduling, coin change, etc.  
- **Recursion & Backtracking**: subset generation, permutations, N-Queens, etc.  
- **Sorting & Searching**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.  
- **Miscellaneous / Competitive Problems**: problems from coding platforms, optimised solutions  

> Each implementation usually has a `.cpp` file with example input-output followed by comments explaining the logic.
